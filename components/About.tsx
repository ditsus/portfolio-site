          Iâ€™m James Sheng, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, 
          passionate about building impactful technology. My experience includes 
          working with web technologies like React, Next.js, and MongoDB, as well as 
          robotics and autonomous vehicles through UTFR, where I lead development 
          on perception systems.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy solving algorithmic problems, 
          competing in hackathons, and exploring new tools to create meaningful projects.
